# Animal Trivia Quiz App
âœ¨ Deployed link: https://sarveshdandapati.github.io/quizApp/

This project is a quiz app I made to entertain my seven-year-old cousin. She likes to play quizzes based on general knowledge. 
I created a home page explaining the game. It has a 50-second timer, so either the time elapses, or you finish answering the questions. If you answer the question correctly or incorrectly, the screen prompts you but does not reveal the answer. Ultimately, it shows the final score and asks you to enter your initials. You can also see the high scores obtained by you.
